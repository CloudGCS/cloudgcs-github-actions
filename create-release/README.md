# ðŸ“¦ Create Release GitHub Action

## Overview

**Create Release** is a custom GitHub Action that automates the process of:

- Creating a GitHub Release with a specified version tag
- Adding a release name and autogenerated date
- Uploading a specified file (e.g., a changelog or binary) to the release assets

This action is ideal for CI/CD pipelines where tagging a release and sharing associated files (like changelogs or builds) is part of the deployment or publishing process.
