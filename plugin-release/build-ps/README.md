# ðŸ§© Build PS Plugin GitHub Action

## Overview

**Build PS Plugin** is a custom GitHub Action that builds a Pilot Station (PS) plugin, typically a React-based frontend application. After building, it uploads the compiled `.js` output as an artifact.

This action simplifies continuous delivery for front-end plugin code and is ideal for systems where PS plugins are deployed independently.

## What It Does

1. **Sets up Node.js (v20)** for the build environment
2. **Installs dependencies** using `yarn install`
3. **Builds the plugin** using a custom `yarn action-build` command
4. **Uploads the final `.js` build artifacts** as a GitHub Actions artifact

> ðŸ”§ Ensure your project has a `yarn action-build` script defined in `package.json` (e.g., a specialized production or plugin build step).
