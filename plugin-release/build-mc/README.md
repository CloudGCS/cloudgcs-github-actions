# üõ†Ô∏è Build MC Plugin GitHub Action

## Overview

**Build MC Plugin** is a custom GitHub Action that builds a Mission Controller (.NET) plugin, zips the compiled output, and uploads it as a GitHub Actions artifact.

It is designed to work seamlessly with GitHub-hosted NuGet packages and is useful in CI/CD pipelines where .NET-based MC plugins need to be compiled and released.
