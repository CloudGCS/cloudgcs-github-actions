# üöÄ Pre Setup for Plugin Release

## Overview

The **Pre Setup for Plugin Release** GitHub Action is designed to prepare and validate plugin release environments for both **Mission Controller (MC)** and **Pilot Station (PS)** components. It ensures that:

- Required paths are set based on the plugins to be released.
- Plugin versions are matched across components.
- Plugin names are consistent.
- Changelog file is verified if Slack notifications are enabled.

This action is typically used at the beginning of a release pipeline to ensure consistency across plugin builds.
