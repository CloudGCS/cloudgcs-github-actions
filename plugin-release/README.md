---

## Workflow Trigger

- Manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`.
- Input:
  - `notify-slack` (boolean) â€” enables Slack notifications (requires changelog file).

| `include_mc`     | Whether to include MC plugin in the build.     |
| `include_ps`     | Whether to include PS plugin in the build.     |
| `ps_path`        | Path to the Pilot Station plugin.              |
| `mc_path`        | Path to the Mission Controller plugin.         |
| `mc_csproj_path` | Path to the Mission Controller `.csproj` file. |

## Jobs

### 1. Pre-Setup

- [Pre-Setup Documentation](./pre-setup/README.md)

### 2. Build PS Plugin

- Set the `include_ps` is `true` if your reposityor includes pilot station plugin
- [Build PS Plugin Documentation](./build-ps/README.md)

### 3. Build MC Plugin

- Set the `include_mc` is `true` if your reposityor includes mission controller plugin
- [Build MC Plugin Documentation](./build-mc/README.md)

### 4. Publish Release

- [Publish Release Documentation](./publish-release/README.md)

---

## Secrets

- `PASSWORD` and `USERNAME` for MC build authentication.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub release publishing.

---

## Notes

- Supports building MC only, PS only, or both.
- Validates version consistency between MC and PS plugins.
- Requires changelog file if Slack notifications enabled.
